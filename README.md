# Line by line file reader
Program made in 42 for reading files line by line.

(Tested with bible 🙏🕊️)

The aim of this program is being iterated in a main.c to read a file line by line for parsing config files purposes.

CAUTION: everytime it writes a line returns 1 but in the last line returns 0 and will be saved as like as the ones before.
